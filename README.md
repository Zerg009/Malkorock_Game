The hero of the game is a young adventurer who discovers an ancient artifact hidden deep within a cave. 
Little does he know, the artifact has the power to throws fireballs, and it's not long before the creatures of the cave are under his control.

As the hero makes his way through the cave, he discovers that there are more artifacts to be found, scattered throughout the citadel, city, and forest. 
With each artifact he collects, the hero gains more control over the monsters, allowing him to use their unique abilities to navigate the treacherous terrain.

However, as the hero becomes more powerful, he begins to attract the attention of a powerful villain who seeks to take the artifacts for himself. 
The villain sends his own monsters to try and stop the hero, leading to epic battles throughout each of the game's locations.

Ultimately, the hero must collect all of the artifacts and confront the villain in a final showdown, 
using his wits and the powers of the monsters under his control to emerge victorious and save the world from the villain's evil plans.
